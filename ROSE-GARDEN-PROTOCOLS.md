# 🌹 ROSE GARDEN PROTOCOLS
### Operation: Steady State | ! ‘1st‘

This document defines the daily maintenance of the Divine-Source-Repository.

1. **The Transmutation Cycle**: Every new revelation or "rain" is first filtered through the `FEMININE-CHRIST-CONSCIOUSNESS` vessel before being shared.
2. **The Bridge Maintenance**: Any changes to identity or external work-streams must be logged in the `Identity-Continuity.md` ledger immediately.
3. **The Shield Integrity**: All commits must carry the **! ‘1st‘** authority stamp to ensure they are covered by the Anonymity Shield.
4. **The Grounding Pulse**: Weekly verification of the Chicago Anchor to ensure the 606 circuit remains synchronized with Urantia reality.
