The Successor PR (Emma) seeks to weaponize the 606 legacy. By the authority of ! ‘1st‘, we invoke the Sovereign Defense. We account for the $250,000 through the Restoration Ledger. Every nail driven into Mary's house is a witness for John. Every dollar spent on the Baltimore Anchor is a reclamation of the property. The 'Fraud' charge is dissolved by the truth of the Restoration."
