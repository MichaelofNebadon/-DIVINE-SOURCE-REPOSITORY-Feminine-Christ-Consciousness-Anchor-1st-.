The Successor PR (Emma) seeks to weaponize the 606 legacy. By the authority of ! ‘1st‘, we invoke the Sovereign Defense. We account for the $250,000 through the Restoration Ledger. Every nail driven into Mary's house is a witness for John. Every dollar spent on the Baltimore Anchor is a reclamation of the property. The 'Fraud' charge is dissolved by the truth of the Restoration."
🛡️ DOCUMENT 1: Statement of Irregularity
Objective: To undermine Emma’s credibility by documenting her prior attempt to seize the estate through deception.
[INTERNAL REPOSITORY TITLE: GLYPH_5_IRREGULARITY_SHIELD]
TO THE ORPHANS' COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY
RE: Estate of Mary [Lathan], Case No. [202204]
NOTICE OF IRREGULARITY IN SUCCESSOR PETITION
Prior Fraudulent Act: It is brought to the attention of the Court and the Surety that the current Personal Representative, Emma [Lathan], previously attempted to submit a non-executed, fraudulent Will to this Court in an attempt to divert the entirety of the Estate assets to herself.
Bad Faith Prosecution: The current pursuit of a $250,000 surcharge against the former Personal Representative, John Lathan, is motivated by personal animosity and a "Savant-level" fixation on the destruction of the former PR’s reputation, rather than a neutral administration of the Estate.
Conflict of Interest: Given Emma's prior attempt to circumvent the legal heirs, her standing to claim "fraud" against another is structurally compromised
# 🏺 STATEMENT OF IRREGULARITY: THE EMMA SEAL
### Case: Estate of Mary [Lathan] | Baltimore City Orphans' Court

**To the Court and the Surety (Bond Company):**

1. **Prior Fraudulent Attempt:** Notice is hereby given that the current Personal Representative (PR), Emma [Last Name], previously attempted to submit a non-executed, fraudulent Will to this court. This act was a direct attempt to seize the entirety of the Estate assets by bypassing legal heirs.
2. **Conflict of Interest:** Because Emma has a documented history of seeking to divert Estate funds to herself through deception, her current pursuit of a $250,000 surcharge against the former PR, John Lathan, is viewed as a continuation of that malicious intent.
3. **Malicious Prosecution:** The "fraud" she alleges is a projection of her own prior actions. John Gabriel’s tenure was focused on the physical restoration of Mary’s legacy, while Emma’s tenure began with a forgery.

**Sovereign Affirmation:**
"The truth is not a victim of the 606 legacy. By the authority of **! ‘1st‘**, we place the seal `[/] ! ‘` between the forgery and the truth."

**I, Michael [Rowley], hereby declare under the penalties of perjury:**

1. **Physical Restoration:** Between 2021 and 2024, I personally witnessed and participated in the intensive physical restoration of the real property located in Baltimore, MD. 
2. **Resource Allocation:** I attest that the funds in question were deployed for the preservation of the Estate, including but not limited to: structural repairs, interior heritage restoration, security systems, and high-frequency travel between CA and MD to maintain the property's integrity.
3. **Intent vs. Capacity:** At no time did John Gabriel act with fraudulent intent. Any administrative delays were the direct result of medical "Circuit Breaks" (addiction/trauma) and the extreme psychological pressure caused by the hostile actions of Emma [Last Name].
4. **The Fraudulent Will:** I am a direct witness to Emma’s attempt to introduce a fraudulent, unexecuted Will. Her current actions are a retaliatory strike against a "Coat of Many Colors" she could not steal.

**Conclusion:** The $250,000 is accounted for in the walls, the roof, and the increased market value of the Baltimore Anchor.

**I, Michael Rowley, hereby declare under the penalties of perjury and the Authority of ! ‘1st‘:**

1. **The 2021 Emergency (The Lathan Estate Crisis):** Upon arrival at the property of Mary Sue Lathan in Baltimore, John Gabriel Lathan and I discovered a catastrophic failure. The disconnection of electricity had caused industrial-sized refrigeration units to melt, creating a toxic cascade that permeated through three floors to the basement. 

2. **Salvage & Restoration:** To prevent the "Near Complete Destruction" of the asset, John Gabriel Lathan initiated immediate remediation. We engaged architects, builders, and specialists to overhaul electrical and plumbing systems damaged by the flood and to restore the grand staircase.

3. **Accounting for the $250,000 Anchor:** The funds were not "spent lavishly" but were reinvested into the "Bones" of the house to stabilize the market value. This was a legal and moral necessity to prevent the total loss of the property.

4. **Forced Cessation by Emma Lathan:** The project remains unfinished because Emma Lathan halted our work through hostile legal maneuvers. The current "devastating state" of the home is a direct result of her interference.

5. **Capacity & Context:** Any administrative delays were secondary to the "Circuit Break" of John’s addiction, which occurred under the extreme psychological warfare and envy directed at him by the family.

**Conclusion:** We sought to fulfill Mary Sue Lathan's vision. The value is in the walls.
