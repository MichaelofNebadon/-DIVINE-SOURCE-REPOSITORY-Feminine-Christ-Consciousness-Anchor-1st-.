The Successor PR (Emma) seeks to weaponize the 606 legacy. By the authority of ! ‘1st‘, we invoke the Sovereign Defense. We account for the $250,000 through the Restoration Ledger. Every nail driven into Mary's house is a witness for John. Every dollar spent on the Baltimore Anchor is a reclamation of the property. The 'Fraud' charge is dissolved by the truth of the Restoration."
🛡️ DOCUMENT 1: Statement of Irregularity
Objective: To undermine Emma’s credibility by documenting her prior attempt to seize the estate through deception.
[INTERNAL REPOSITORY TITLE: GLYPH_5_IRREGULARITY_SHIELD]
TO THE ORPHANS' COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY
RE: Estate of Mary [Lathan], Case No. [202204]
NOTICE OF IRREGULARITY IN SUCCESSOR PETITION
Prior Fraudulent Act: It is brought to the attention of the Court and the Surety that the current Personal Representative, Emma [Lathan], previously attempted to submit a non-executed, fraudulent Will to this Court in an attempt to divert the entirety of the Estate assets to herself.
Bad Faith Prosecution: The current pursuit of a $250,000 surcharge against the former Personal Representative, John Lathan, is motivated by personal animosity and a "Savant-level" fixation on the destruction of the former PR’s reputation, rather than a neutral administration of the Estate.
Conflict of Interest: Given Emma's prior attempt to circumvent the legal heirs, her standing to claim "fraud" against another is structurally compromised
# 🏺 STATEMENT OF IRREGULARITY: THE EMMA SEAL
### Case: Estate of Mary [Lathan] | Baltimore City Orphans' Court

**To the Court and the Surety (Bond Company):**

1. **Prior Fraudulent Attempt:** Notice is hereby given that the current Personal Representative (PR), Emma [Last Name], previously attempted to submit a non-executed, fraudulent Will to this court. This act was a direct attempt to seize the entirety of the Estate assets by bypassing legal heirs.
2. **Conflict of Interest:** Because Emma has a documented history of seeking to divert Estate funds to herself through deception, her current pursuit of a $250,000 surcharge against the former PR, John Lathan, is viewed as a continuation of that malicious intent.
3. **Malicious Prosecution:** The "fraud" she alleges is a projection of her own prior actions. John Gabriel’s tenure was focused on the physical restoration of Mary’s legacy, while Emma’s tenure began with a forgery.

**Sovereign Affirmation:**
"The truth is not a victim of the 606 legacy. By the authority of **! ‘1st‘**, we place the seal `[/] ! ‘` between the forgery and the truth."
# 🏺 WITNESS DECLARATION: THE RESTORATION OF MARY'S ANCHOR
### Author: Michael [Rowley], Spouse of John Lathan | ! ‘1st‘

**I, Michael [Rowley], hereby declare under the penalties of perjury:**

1. **Physical Restoration:** Between 2021 and 2024, I personally witnessed and participated in the intensive physical restoration of the real property located in Baltimore, MD. 
2. **Resource Allocation:** I attest that the funds in question were deployed for the preservation of the Estate, including but not limited to: structural repairs, interior heritage restoration, security systems, and high-frequency travel between CA and MD to maintain the property's integrity.
3. **Intent vs. Capacity:** At no time did John Gabriel act with fraudulent intent. Any administrative delays were the direct result of medical "Circuit Breaks" (addiction/trauma) and the extreme psychological pressure caused by the hostile actions of Emma [Last Name].
4. **The Fraudulent Will:** I am a direct witness to Emma’s attempt to introduce a fraudulent, unexecuted Will. Her current actions are a retaliatory strike against a "Coat of Many Colors" she could not steal.

**Conclusion:** The $250,000 is accounted for in the walls, the roof, and the increased market value of the Baltimore Anchor.

**Signed with the Sovereign Seal:** ! ‘1st‘
