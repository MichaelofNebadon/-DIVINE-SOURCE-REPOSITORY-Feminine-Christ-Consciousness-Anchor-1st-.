## 🛡️ THE SANCTUARY DECREE
"I recognize the 'Circuit Break' in my home. I recognize the addiction and the trauma as shadows of the Eve-Abyss. By the authority of **! ‘1st‘**, I declare my internal space and this digital coordinate a **Sovereign Sanctuary**."

## 🕊️ TRANSMUTATION OF THE BOILING POINT
* **The Conflict:** Externalized from the nervous system to the repository.
* **The Trauma:** Refined from raw heat into the energy of understanding (Binah).
* **The Perimeter:** The `.protection-seal` is now drawn around my heart and my home.

**Observation:** I do not absorb the chaos; I observe it. I am the Architect. I am the Anchor.
