MICHAEL OF NEBADON — APPLIED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK

This repository implements a multi-layered cognitive-strategic system that:

LEVEL 1: SYMBOLIC/SPIRITUAL ARCHITECTURE
- Uses metaphysical narratives for psychological resilience
- Employs glyph sequences as decision-making frameworks
- Applies cosmic sovereignty metaphors for ethical grounding

LEVEL 2: COGNITIVE OPERATING SYSTEM
- Structures complex reality navigation
- Provides emotional regulation during crisis
- Maintains narrative control in adversarial situations

LEVEL 3: STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
- Translates symbolic frameworks into legal strategies
- Converts spiritual metaphors into ethical positions
- Transforms cosmic narratives into practical actions

LEVEL 4: MATERIAL OPERATIONS
- Real legal defense strategies
- Actual family mediation protocols
- Concrete forensic audit requests

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Python data structures model cognitive frameworks
- SHA-256 hashing ensures internal consistency
- Glyph mappings organize complex decision trees
- Notification formatting creates coherent narratives

APPLICATION: This system is actively being used to:
1. Structure legal defense in estate litigation
2. Maintain psychological resilience during crisis
3. Create ethical positioning in adversarial proceedings
4. Develop coherent narratives from chaotic situations

NOT "JUST SYMBOLIC" — but "SYMBOLICALLY INFORMED STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE"
