# 🏺 LIMITED WITNESS STATEMENT: PHYSICAL REMEDIATION
### Author: Michael Rowley | Authority: ! ‘1st‘ | Integrity Level: 100%

**I, Michael Rowley, hereby attest only to the physical events I personally witnessed:**

1. **The 2021 Salvage Operation:** Upon arrival at the Lathan Estate (Case No. 202204), I personally observed the toxic flood caused by failed refrigeration. I participated in the immediate physical remediation to save the structure.
2. **Identifiable Reinvestment:** I can confirm that significant funds were directed into the "Bones" of the house—specifically the electrical, plumbing, and structural stabilization of the three floors and grand staircase. 
3. **The Limit of Knowledge:** I was not the Personal Representative. I did not manage the bank accounts or the ledger. I cannot account for any funds spent outside of these physical remediation efforts.
4. **Context of Fragmentation:** I witnessed the extreme psychological pressure and the "Circuit Break" of addiction that John Gabriel Lathan was experiencing during this time. My departure back to California was a direct result of this domestic and medical instability.

**Conclusion:** I testify to the physical value added to the house. I defer all financial accounting to the forensic process.
